Go to Life’s lesson from this pandemic,"[<p>I still remember – It was that one of those cold nights of November, sitting with my family over dinner, casually I picked up my Televisions remote control, I was surfing various channels and then I got glued to this news channel, where the reporter was covering the Corona outbreak news in Wuhan, China</p>, <p>Before it was known as Covid-19 or even just a “coronavirus”, the viral outbreak that would go on to become a global pandemic was referred to as simply “mysterious pneumonia-like illness” or “flu-like illness” in Wuhan or China. It wasn’t until late January that it finally became household news on mainstream news channels. Looking more closely at some of the earliest mentions of the outbreak, the details emerging in the first days of January were strongly suggestive of a serious health threat despite receiving little to no media attention in most of the countries in the world.</p>, <p>Until January 2020, Corona to me meant “the rarefied gaseous envelope of the sun and other stars. The sun’s corona is normally visible only during a total solar eclipse when it is seen as an irregularly shaped pearly glow surrounding the darkened disc of the moon”</p>, <p>But soon after that, I realized the magnitude and strength of the word “Corona”. Now the World realizes this Crown does not bring glory to the wearer but on the contrary, threatens to take away the most precious God’s gift of life.</p>, <p>I am a believer of Hindu philosophy, I strongly believe in Karma….I understand the Compound effect of the action. The last time CO2 was this high in the Earth’s atmosphere, Humans didn’t exist.</p>, <p>Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world’s seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now.</p>, <p>As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where we’re rapidly headed now.</p>, <p>The question was – is this pandemic God’s way of warning us to take care of our activities?</p>, <p>When humans fail to take actions, nature emerges and corrects itself.. remember Nature’s Law Of Balance.</p>, <p>No war, no recession, no previous pandemic has had such a dramatic impact on emissions of CO2 over the past century as Covid-19 has in a few short months. Multiple sources indicate we are now living through an unrivalled drop in carbon output.</p>, <p>My faith in the Teachings of Gita only grew stronger—wherein it states in the Equality of all beings. The virus does not discriminate, from President Donald Trump to a small peasant, the situation has shown us that we are all the same regardless of our religion, culture, customs, whether we are poor or rich. The virus simply does not choose.</p>, <p>As manifested by Lord Krishna himself: “My true devotee does not feel hatred for any being, but is friendly and compassionate towards all, without the thoughts of I-and-mine” We simply cannot live without relationships. This pandemic has taught me all about compassion, sharing and caring.</p>, <p>I am understanding my life for the better. The lockdown period has given me time to retrospect, what I want from my life to where I am taking myself to. This period has helped me find my self and my purpose in life.</p>, <p>I now understand the real meaning of Happiness. Happiness is not in materialistic pleasure, achieving big things which you enjoy alone, but it is in small things in life you share with other people.</p>, <p>I have emerged from here, I will now not wait for bad to happen, I already appreciate what nature has given me. I am conserving happiness from every small thing that God has given me. I am doing things which I have always wanted to do earlier, but couldn’t do because of the proximity of time and things like that. I realize that reading a book with a cup of coffee makes me happy. I have realized, how working together at home, doing work like washing, cooking, mopping and things like that gives me immense pleasure because I am with my Family.</p>, <p>The utmost important life lesson learnt is:” Life is precious, live every day to its fullest, I know obstacles will come, but I have learnt to overcome them. I am living each day, enjoying my life and appreciating what I have. In doing so not one day I have Lost my Faith in HIM.</p>, <p>The best thing is that I have started believing in The Power Of Magic and Faith even more</p>]"
Go to Is Delhi NCR Winter Ready?,"[<p>While a lockdown was imposed by the Government of India in March 2020 to mitigate community spread of the coronavirus which impacted every single individual in its own way. The lockdown initially shut down major economic activities except for essential services. Every activity whether economic, social, political or legal was affected in the fight against the invisible. As on date, people are adapting to the new normal in terms of the rules and regulations that have been put in place to prevent the spread of COVID- 19.</p>, <p>With winter approaching comes, the rise in air pollution levels in Delhi NCR region. There are various factors like Open dumping and burning of garbage, Road dust, Unpaved roads, demolition and construction sites, an overly populated city with traffic congestion, etc., which contribute to the winter smog in Delhi but also these put aside, there remains one major contributor to air pollution namely the practice of Stubble Burning by farmers. Stubble Burning is a practice followed by the farmers where they set fire to the crop residue in order to eliminate the same. Despite various decisions of the Courts and Tribunals, regulations by the Government, the farmers continue their practice of burning stubble every year. One may blame lack of technology in India or they lack knowledge of such technology amongst farmers but is that a reasonable explanation to put so many human beings residing within the State of NCT of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh at the risk of developing ailments on account of poor air quality due to the practice of Stubble Burning. Also, can such violation of the right to clean air as stands protected within the purview the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution be allowed, only on the pretext that the farmers do not have an adequate amount of time to clear the stubble from their fields and for they find it convenient to set the stubble to fire.</p>, <p>In the year 2018, National Green Tribunal (NGT), New Delhi took cognizance on some of the newspaper reports indicating excessive crop residue burning in Smt. Ganga Lalwani V. Union of India and Ors. The National Green Tribunal directed Chief Secretaries of States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi to communicate to the court a strategic plan and action to prevent crop residue burning. The Government of India and the State Governments tried to implement some mechanisms to prevent the farmers from indulging into stubble burning activities. But even last year the farmers burnt the crop residue which resulted in unsafe Air Quality Index in and around Delhi NCR region.</p>, <p>Taking cognizance of the poor management of the problems relating to stubble burning by the Government, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on 04.11.2019 stepped in to hold the Government and Government bodies responsible for the health hazard caused due to stubble burning. The Hon’ble Court while taking cognizance of the level of pollution in Delhi and NCR region observed that<em> “There cannot be large scale exodus. People have to perform their duty in Delhi also and people cannot be evacuated from Delhi being a capital city. We are at a loss to understand why we are not able to create a situation in which this kind of pollution does not take place, that too in a routine manner every year. Obviously, it is writ large that the State Governments, Government of NCT of Delhi and civic bodies have miserably failed to discharge their liability as per the directive principles of State Policy which have found statutory expression, they are being made statutory mockery and also the directions of this Court and High Courts in this regard are being violated with impunity.”</em> The Hon’ble Supreme Court fixed the liability of the State and State Authorities to ensure that the farmers are made aware of their responsibility and liability towards other human beings so that they desist from stubble burning in future. The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed stubble burning to be a situation destroying the right to life itself.</p>, <p>Today, when the country is recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic, are the State Governments prepared enough to ensure that no stubble burning takes place this year. Unlike last year any further shutting down of construction activities or stoppage of coal-based industries, other industries will have a long-lasting impact on the revival of the economic conditions of the country. The stoppage of the functioning of economic activities on account of stubble burning this year will have serious financial implications for the industries as well as the individuals employed in these industries as every individual today is struggling to recover from the blows of the unforeseeable pandemic. Hence, in these circumstances where the citizens of the country are already facing harsh economic conditions due to loss of job and salary cuts, shutting down of any economic operations to curb the ill-effects of stubble burning will put the people under the sword.</p>, <p>On the 01.10.2020, the Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar held a meeting with State Environment Ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the secretaries of pollution control boards and representatives from Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council to check the preparedness of the State machinery and the proposed preventive measures which could be put into place to prevent crop residue burning during this winter season. The Union Minister said that this year a new technology developed by Pusa Agriculture Institute to decompose straw in the fields will be used in Delhi-NCR and in Uttar Pradesh (UP) as informed by the environment ministers of these States to prevent the farmers from burning crop residue, in addition to several other initiatives discussed by the participants of the meeting.  It is now imperative upon the State Governments to take sufficient and effective preventive steps to ensure that the farmers are made aware of the deleterious impact of stubble burning on human life. Further, it is also essential that the advanced technology as proposed by the State Governments reaches the farmers well within time so as to relieve the farmers of the hardship of clearing the stubble from their fields and also to protect the interests of all those who battle to breathe clean air in Delhi NCR and nearby regions during the winter season. As the old saying goes <em>“Prevention is better than cure”</em>.</p>]"
Go to Why we need to worry about Climate Change?,"[<p>If I recall a few natural disasters from the past few months only  :</p>, <p>It is terrifying, right?</p>, <p>The thing is, even without a complete picture, there is scientific consensus that climate change is happening and is “extremely likely” due to human activities. This consensus has been around for the past 10 years or so and is only growing stronger as technology helps scientists create more accurate models for understanding and predicting planetary shifts.</p>, <p>What is causing climate change?</p>, <p>Causes are both natural and anthropogenic, but anthropogenic changes are disrupting more.</p>, <p>We humans are the ones who burn fossil fuels and chopping down forests, causing average temperatures to rise worldwide. That global warming trend is increasingly disrupting our climate — the average weather over many years.</p>, <p>Earth has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius, since the 19th century, before the industry started to boom.</p>, <p>A warmer world — even by a half-degree Celsius — has more evaporation, leading to more water in the atmosphere. Such changing conditions put our agriculture, health, water supply and more at risk.</p>, <p>A warming planet means glaciers and permafrost are melting at a high rate. Why does this matter? For one, more water creates more heat in the atmosphere. The melting permafrost releases additional greenhouse gases. As the oceans get hotter, they become more acidic, which harms sea creatures. As Arctic ice disappears, animals that depend on that landscape are becoming endangered. Glacial melting also reduces the world’s supply of freshwater, since they store about 75% of the world’s supply.</p>, <p>There’s also a scientific belief that melting permafrost will release infectious diseases thought long-gone into human populations, threatening human health on a large scale.</p>, <p>IPCC says: “A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events.”</p>, <p>Reasons why we need to worry :</p>, <p>WE ALL NEED CLEAN WATER</p>, <p>-2 in every 3 people worldwide live in regions of severe water. Even a small increase in global temperatures will destabilize the water cycle and could make water scarcity much worse. Climate change affects rainfall patterns, meaning both drought and flooding will be more common, and more intense.</p>, <p>2. WE ALL DESERVE TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR</p>, <p>With anthropogenic climate change driven by human-caused emissions to the atmosphere, it stands to reason that we face compromised air quality. This affects human health, especially children. Air pollution can lead to asthma, heart and lung disease.</p>, <p>3. WE ARE ALL AFFECTED, NO MATTER WHERE IN THE WORLD WE LIVE</p>, <p>Climate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel the effects of climate change.</p>, <p>4. FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS</p>, <p>We are so blessed to be living on such a beautiful planet, but if we look at the conditions and what all is happening, maybe future generations won’t be able to nurture the same.</p>, <p>If you’re feeling worried by now, you’re not alone.</p>, <p>We need to understand our responsibilities and work towards the betterment of our planet. No matter where you live, you will be affected, so start today, your journey towards green life.</p>, <p>WE NEED THE EARTH, EARTH DOESN’T NEED US.</p>, <p>TOGETHER WE CAN.</p>]"
Go to Energy security and behavior change,"[<p>The ways of balancing the supply and demand of energy incorporated by an entity in their area of the influenceable domain are called Energy Security.</p>, <p>Workplace buildings globally are responsible for around 20% of carbon emissions, and in the future, the figure may increase manifold. Hence, it is no brainer that changing energy use behaviours in these environments can lead to considerable carbon savings.</p>, <p>The common barriers to any behaviour change are demographics, socio-cultural factors, economics, and internal factors such as motivations, values, knowledge, and priorities.</p>, <p>There are many different behaviour change frameworks, but one of the most widely used and unified frameworks is Behavior Change Wheel or BCW.</p>, <p>In BCW, behaviour change origins are divided into the “COM-B system,” which hypothesized that an individual’s Capability, the opportunity presented, and intrinsic Motivation comes together and generates behaviour.</p>, <p>Here, Capability is the person’s psycho-physiological characteristics. Motivation is the inner cognitive processes, conscious or sub-conscious, which gives direction to the person. Furthermore, the opportunity is all the factors that come from outside.</p>, <p>Now, how does BCW provides a structure that may help in influencing the workplace energy-saving behaviour?</p>, <p>The desired behaviour change, which is more energy-saving practices, can be achieved by influencing the Intervention functions, which are:</p>, <p>Education: Giving the employee information regarding the issue so that they can understand why it is necessary. E.g., the information about energy-saving actions, feedback on energy use, and building energy audit results.</p>, <p>Persuasion: Influencing the feelings of employees to drive them to take action themselves. E.g., showing them graphs, tables, encouraging text, and images as we are more susceptible to be influenced by what we see.</p>, <p>Incentivization: For making employees feel motivated to act, management makes some arrangements for awarding rewards. A study reported energy savings of 6.4% on public social rewards, and it also reported an increase in energy usage due to private monetary rewards.</p>, <p>Coercion: Creating a belief that unwanted behaviour may have repercussions, such as raising the financial cost to reduce excessive electricity usage.</p>, <p>Training: Imparting skills. With installing new smart energy technologies or systems, the building occupants derive some satisfaction when using the new system, and satisfaction gets achieved if they can use the system.</p>, <p>Restriction: Imposing some form of regulations to reduce participation in the target behaviour.</p>, <p>Environmental Restructuring: The physical or social setting in which the target behaviour is happening is changed, e.g., putting up regular prompts and signs or visual imagery on large TV screens as the act of giving information alone creates significantly less impact. A pilot research report study found that due to the employee being provided feedback by an energy generating console desk resulted in energy savings of 30%.</p>, <p>Modelling: Giving people instances in which they can compare themselves to others. E.g., organizing competitions between colleagues, either individually or in groups, so that they can assess each other’s qualities. A year-long energy-saving campaign, which involved an online platform of information, a website, email reminders, and posters, generated 6.5% average energy savings per building.</p>, <p>Enablement: This process incorporates giving someone the authority or means, which means reducing barriers and increasing means to do something. Around 35% of energy savings reported by two different studies conducted on enablement through the use of an energy console-desk that gave employees the authority to control electronic devices at their desks remotely.</p>, <p>From the above framework and its components, we observed that apart from employing behaviour change programs targeting a person’s actions, it is also essential to have physical infrastructure and technologies to have an integrated successful reduction in energy usage. It is so because how technologies are accepted and seen by employees, their short- and long-term impacts, and their influence on employees’ willingness in energy savings is essential.</p>, <p>According to a Scottish Government report, employing technology and infrastructural changes was the most profitable behaviour change strategy employed in the workplace for energy saving. Furthermore, employing technology changes, giving feedback to users, and activating the social norm was the most enabling strategy in delivering lasting changes on workplace energy-saving behaviours according to a report by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, UK.</p>, <p>Hence, we can conclude that the result of various studies is that engaging employees in any energy-saving program at every stage, creating social and physical opportunities to save energy is the most successful strategy. It shows that employees are also facilitating changes, and their involvement is valued. The other influencing factors are social culture and existing organization dynamics for increasing employees’ motivations to act. The significance of social influence proven by a report showed that rewards and incentives given publicly are relatively more useful than when given privately.</p>, <p>Furthermore, Managers and their attitudes play the central role because of the opportunities developed due to their energy usage decisions. Building owners who have rented the place can also accomplish sustainability goals by placing various energy-saving clauses in rental agreements.</p>]"
Go to Sustainable Production,"[<p>Humans have been consuming resources at an alarming rate that is certainly not as sustainable as the earth that we inhabit cannot regenerate the materials at that rate. For comparison, between 1950 and 2005, worldwide metals production grew six-fold, oil consumption eightfold, and natural gas consumption 14-fold. So, if we continue on the same path, our future generations will not have access to the resources the way that we have now. The harmful effects of our consumption and its final impact on the humankind are well known.</p>, <p>Though production systems create material wealth for humans, they consume a great number of resources while generating a lot of waste. The waste generated during the production processes, during the use of the products and after the end of the life of the products is responsible for the degradation of the environment.</p>, <p>Sustainable production can be defined as a method to maximize efficiency while minimizing waste and reduce environmental impact. The core of sustainable production is what happens on the factory floor. The tool mostly used to implement sustainable production is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA tries to gauge the environmental impact at various production stages starting from raw material acquisition to product use and final disposal. The choices we make affect the direction of sustainability.</p>, <p>Sustainable production requires that all production organisations should aim for the following four activities</p>, <p>• Energy use reduction</p>, <p>• Water use reduction</p>, <p>• Emissions reduction</p>, <p>• Waste generation reduction</p>, <p>Sustainable Production example:</p>, <p>Cutting fluids are used extensively in metal machining processes to remove and reduce the heat during the machining operations. The use of cutting fluids greatly enhances the machining quality while reducing the cost of machining by extending tool life. However, the mist and vapour generated during the machining processes are harmful to the operator and stringent regulations exist to control them. Direct exposure of cutting fluids has been responsible for a number of skin cancer cases. Stringent environmental legislations require that the spent cutting fluids be recycled or disposed of in a manner that is not harmful to the environment. This calls for increased expenditure on the recycling and disposal procedures used depending upon the type of cutting fluid.</p>, <p>The cost and environmental impact lead the researchers to find an alternative to the traditional cutting fluids such as Minimum Quantity Lubricant (MQL) or dry machining which is more eco-friendly. Use of synthetic and vegetable oil-based esters are mostly used. The first type of sustainable vegetable oil base metal fluids used are based oils like triglycerides, but for these base oils, a proper additive is also required. These base oils are biodegradable and can degrade more easily in soil. Data reports indicated that bio-based fluids performed better than mineral-based oils in terms of better chip breaking, higher durability and lower wear and lower cutting forces. Due to the combination of biodegradability, renewability and excellent lubrication performance they are said to be potential environment-friendly lubricants. These green fluids also do not have any harmful chemicals that complicate the disposal procedure and thereby reducing the disposal cost.</p>, <p>Conclusion:</p>, <p>Sustainable production is the most important aspect to be considered by all production engineers, not because it is a fad but a necessity as an obligation to the world we live in. Product Life cycle assessment has become a tool of choice being used to establish the environmental impact of the products that we produce. The three major principles to be considered are reducing the resource utilisation in the process, use environment-friendly materials, reduce all forms of waste and reuse and recycle as much material as possible to realise the goal of the self-recovery capability of the earth.</p>]"
Go to Are electric vehicles sustainable,"[<p>Problem Description: For over 100 years, the majority of the vehicles have relied on burning fossil fuels. However, in the past decade, electric vehicles have become an interestingly important segment for transportation. The owners of electric vehicles have a sense of pride that they are using sustainable energy to run their vehicles and they are doing no harm to nature but from where does the electricity come that powers their vehicles? By burning coal? Are electric vehicles really environmentally sustainable? The production of electric vehicles is typically more energy-intensive than for conventional vehicles.</p>, <p>Prior attempts to solve the problem: We will read about how attempts are being made to solve the problem in question. A large amount of energy is needed to make systems such as battery pack, also batteries contain rare earth metals such as cobalt. However, this isn’t the case for all electric vehicles; many of the latest models have interior parts made from recyclable materials, such as seats, door trim panels and dashboards. For example, BMW says that almost 25% of the interior of its electric i3 car is made of recycled plastics and renewable materials. Also, 95% of the car can be recycled. Currently, the majority of the electric vehicles charge from the grid, meaning they could possibly use fossil fuels as their source of energy. However, in California, electricity is not generated from coal. The main source of energy is natural gas which is a lot cleaner than coal and electric vehicle super giant such as Tesla is gradually shifting towards fully renewable and solar-powered charging stations.</p>, <p>Proposed behavior change strategy and reasoning for the same: The planet Earth is currently facing a great challenge, climate change crisis. Our response to this challenge should echo through society for centuries to come. We need behavior change to solve some of the problems for sustainable development.<br/>
Behavior change – reducing emissions by implementing strict regulations, should be a part of every government and think tanks’ sustainable development scenario because without the intervention of governments, the proposed behavior change would not be effective individually. For now, it is clear that the most sustainable model is that of electric vehicles. Some institutions have already introduced measures to promote the usage of clean energy by reshaping their infrastructure to create emission friendly power supply through solar, wind and nuclear energy.</p>, <p>Behavior change is good news for us as individuals, however, it does need a change of mindset, by focusing on reducing material consumption. Imagine a street used by 100 people who need to get to one place or another. If they choose to travel in their own vehicle, we would be hardly able to see the road. But if they opt for the most sustainable alternative, such as clean public transport or shared electric vehicle by changing the behavior of their mind to use more renewable and sustainable modes of transport, there will be a significant reduction of vehicles on the roads and indirectly which means a smaller number of production of vehicles and less energy being used.<br/>
Conditions under which the proposed would/would not work: The behavior change strategies have their own merits and demerits and will work or would not work under some conditions.<br/>
In developing countries, it is much harder to achieve the proposed behavior due to the fact that they do not have the technology to create an infrastructure to provide renewable energy in huge quantity and due to the unavailability of infrastructure, the cost of using fossil fuels to power the grid is cheaper than setting up a new infrastructure that provides renewable energy. Shifting to a renewable source of energy is a costly affair. The per capita income is also low in the developing countries and it impacts their behavior to not invest much in renewable energy.<br/>
In developed countries, it becomes much easier to achieve the proposed behavior due to the fact that their per capita income is higher and they have the technology and are capable of setting up the infrastructure to produce clean energy. Also, the government in developed countries is so strict that a violation of the rules set by the government can lead to severe consequences.<br/>
Another condition where this would work is where the government provides subsidies to individuals and industries to set up the infrastructure for a renewable source of energy and this will affect their behavior, as behaviors which are rewarded are more likely to be continued.</p>]"
Go to COVID-19 and its effects on the environment,"[<p>Factories shut down, Planes grounded, events cancelled: the Covid-19 has dejected the world’s economy, and has the unpredicted upshot of reduction in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in many developed and developing nations. But then again this decent update for the environment could only be for a short duration.</p>, <p>The new SARS-CoV2, coronavirus came to light in the last year of December month (2019) and has caused an unprecedented impact on the majority of the countries (213 in total). It has spread to 4 million peoples worldwide and had caused more than 3.5 lakhs death, as said by the World Health Organisation. Most of the nations tried to combat the COVID-19 with screening and testing as well as started following the social distancing norms to control the spread of the coronavirus. It seems clear that majority of the governments and private agencies policies revolves around public health, and is lacking other perspectives, mainly environmental issues and because of this, the indirect effect of the coronavirus on the environment has been little investigated and analysed.</p>, <p>Despite the fact that around, 2.2 billion people of the human population does not have proper access to drinking water, they are asked to wash their hands regularly to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Whereas around 4.2 billion people are deprived of safe sanitation system (U.N estimates). Regardless of few positive impact on the environment due to lockdown like, the air pollution has dramatically decreased, as people were asked to stay in their houses and the majority of the vehicles were inside the houses and garages. There has been a sharp decline in environmental noise. Environmental noise can be well defined as an unsolicited sound which is generally, generated by the different kind of anthropogenic activities such as commercial and industrial activities, the transit of vehicles engines and tunes a very high rate. It is perhaps considered as one of the major sources of discomfort to the human population and the surrounding environment, which doesn’t only cause severe health-related issues but it also alters the natural condition of the ecosystem. The imposition of lockdown and quarantine by the different nation’s government has caused people to stay back at their homes, and due to this the movement of people from one place to another has slowed down and the use of private and public transport has decreased significantly. Likewise, on the other hand, the commercial activities are at a standstill process entirely. Because of all these changes, the noise level in most of the cities has dropped considerably.</p>, <p>Also, many beaches around the world got cleaned up and the animals were seen back in cities, but the covid-19 virus has also generated negative and indirect effect on the environment.</p>, <p>The photos of reduced smog in china, roaming of wilder animals on the streets of New York in U.S.A and London, unpolluted canals in Italy has been shared across all the social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram over the past few months has helped and given hope to the dispirited global population. Conversely, some of those images are an example of harmful misinterpretation and propaganda that has been circulated across the internet throughout the global pandemic, they have disseminated an inaccurate description of the environment backed by few days of lockdown and quarantine, and they had brushed off the destructive environmental impacts that have arisen.</p>, <p>Stopped Recycling, but what after?</p>, <p>To begin, due to the coronavirus pandemic, some of the developed countries have abundant their sustainability programs related to the environment like- in the United States of America, some cities and small municipalities have suspended their waste recycling plants as the in-charge authorities have concerned regarding the spread of the virus in the recycling centres. Likewise, Italy has asked their infected citizens to stop sorting and segregating the waste at their homes and offices. On the other hand, many other European nation-states particularly which are most affected due to the pandemic has restricted the sustainable waste management system. In addition many firms, corporations and restaurants have again started the trend of use of single-use plastic in place of reusable bags and containers. For example, Starbucks, a coffee company in the month of March 2020, has announced a temporary ban on the use of recyclable and reusable cups.</p>, <p>Furthermore, a large number of people are isolated at their homes and due to lockdown majority of the malls, shops, restaurants and food outlets are closed, so the online purchase and food delivery are quite very high. This has led to more use of single-use plastic as well as it has created more demand for the need of fossil fuel for individual transportation and mobility for the supply of goods. There has been a huge upsurge of medical waste- as the products used by the healthcare professionals are generally single-use items that can be worn only once before they are being disposed of. Like the use of mask, personal protection kits, and gloves. For example, a hospital in Wuhan produced around 200 tons of medical waste per day in the course of the peak of the pandemic breakout, as compared to 50 tons more than the usual average waste.</p>, <p>The Increasing waste</p>, <p>The prompt of the inorganic waste &amp; the organic waste is ramblingly supplemented by various environmental problems and issues, like water pollution, soil erosion, air and deforestation. The policies adopted by different governments during the coronavirus pandemic like lockdown and quarantine in most countries has created a new demand in the market of online shopping and home delivery systems. Therefore, the organic waste produced has become very high in the households. On the other hand, the food items which are brought online are shipped in single-use and plastic bags and containers, and it has led to an increase in the inorganic waste.</p>, <p>Medical and Clinical Waste</p>, <p>Similarly, the medical waste generated is also very high. Like in U.S.A the medical waste is increased due to usage of single-use Medicare products like Gloves and PPE kits and hospitals in Wuhan are producing more medical waste during the pandemic as compared to the usual waste generated (During the coronavirus pandemic, Wuhan hospital generated 200 metric tons of medical waste and it was 50 million more than the usual medical waste generate).</p>, <p>The demand for mask during the pandemic has touched the sky but the elements required for this mask are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally made up of non-woven fabrics. Polyester, Polystyrene, polyethene and polycarbonate, are some common material used for the surgical mask whose density lies between 20grams to 25 grams/sq. metre. These all are liquid resistance and plastic-based products and they have a very high afterlife after being discarded. They end up filling the landfills and oceans. For example in Hong Kong, recently there these clinical waste has already started to affect and degrade the environment.</p>, <p>Certain portions of the population are at risk of adverse impacts from exposure to medical waste as well, such as cleaners, garbage collectors and other people who spend a great deal of time in public spaces. Even as governments across the world are urging students to stay away from schools and universities, and white-collar employees are availing work-from-home options, those at the frontline of keeping cities clean have to go about their daily chores, making them one of the most vulnerable groups and one that is most susceptible to the virus from droplets that may linger on the masks. They may also catch other forms of infection from pathogens remaining on these discarded pieces of garbage, such as meningitis and Hepatitis B and C.</p>, <p>Mountains of waste: A helping hand to Greenhouse Gas</p>, <p>As the recycling plants are on hold the waste generated by different means is kept on increasing and it is a cause of concern as the deposited waste in many areas are becoming a pile of small mountains and their deposition at open areas is making the surrounding more vulnerable and creating a high risk related to air pollution as the dumped open waste is left to decay there is a greater chance of increased level of methane (CH4) emission, a greenhouse gas. It is not only going to affect the surrounding areas but it will also affect the people living in the near-by areas too.</p>, <p>Eco-systems at risk</p>, <p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the natural ecosystem and different varieties of protected flora and fauna species are at a much greater risk. As many countries have ordered lockdown and asked the people to stay at their homes, the peoples working in the protected areas mainly in Natural parks, marine conservation zones and wildlife Sanctuaries are stuck at their homes, leaving these places and zones unmonitored. The absences of these people have marked a huge rise in the wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation and fishing activities.</p>, <p>On the other hand the, the sudden shutdown of ecotourism activities in tourist destinations and in the forest areas has left the ecosystem at much higher risk of encroachment and illegal harvesting. Additionally, as ecotourism is considered to be a major source of an economic mainstay in many places, the increasing unemployment rate due to the pandemic could force people to gather resources from the most brittle ecosystem and environment, to meet their household demands for food and income.</p>, <p>Other Indirect effects on the environment</p>, <p>Some nations like China has asked their authorities and local governing bodies to brace up their disinfection routine mainly, to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plants to stop the spread of the virus but on the other hand, there is no solid evidence on the survival of coronavirus in wastewater as well as in the drinking water (WHO, 2020). Despite the fact that excess of chlorine in water could lead to harmful problems and issues related to people’s health like bladder cancer and it also damages the cells.</p>, <p>COVID-19 is a reminder that human health is linked to the planet’s health. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. They account for seventy-five per cent of all emerging infectious diseases. As the coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the globe, the governments and agencies top priority is to control the spread of the virus but we need to shift the spotlight soon on the management and treatment of the waste (especially clinical and medical waste) generated around the world and how effective is the measure taken is or to be. Likewise, at the same time we as an individual need to step up and follow the necessary guideline for disposing of the waste and medical gears.</p>, <p>In spite of everything, these actions could reverse what beneficial environmental effects have arisen from the pandemic response. A similar case can be seen with the 2008 financial crash – although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of 1.3%, as the economy recovered in 2010, emissions were at an all-time high. After all, it is only through mutual empathy and goodwill that we will see the world emerge stronger from this global pandemic. To prevent future outbreaks, we must address the threats to ecosystems and wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution and climate change.</p>]"
Go to Fresh Breeze,"[<p>Fresh breeze is something we can feel it and enjoy it with our own happiness, everyone wants to have a happy and old routine life as we had before 2020 -COVID but we realized it only after it slipped out of our hands and made us realize what we were owing before this Covid pandemic.</p>, <p>We can have this fresh breeze in our daily life with fresh thoughts, positive energy, regular good exercises and with supportive words towards your family because this will help us to be self-motivated and encourage others to keep going on their path.</p>, <p>Due to this Covid, many have to suffer in many other ways like some can’t visit to meet their parents or family in India who stays abroad, some can’t find an appropriate job, suitable marriage alliances, limited medical facilities for treatments, older people’s lost their jobs, students can’t have their childhood memories with school, many people’s lost their life’s and many more.</p>, <p>Nobody would have imagined that we will have a very slow and lockdown life in our country to get rid of the harmful life-threatening virus, though we have managed to survive our life in this critical period and reached towards the end of 2020, hoping everybody will help our environment to be clean with their own thoughts and positive approach towards life and have encouraging words towards your family, friends and in your professional life because it can only help us to make our environment clean and end this Covid situation soon in next months.</p>, <p>This Covid has given us lot of quality time to be with our family in this busy world so we can’t blame it completely and taught us many things in different ways like how to be calm in this emergency situation, how to engage ourself in other activities like cooking, gardening, understanding people with safe distance via the internet or phone call and get satisfaction out of it. It also taught us to have a  healthy life by making your own meal and no to outside food,  look after your health by having immunity-related foods. Many of them have started online YouTube food channels, YouTube Art channel and many channels to engage themselves and motive others as well, even schools are also online nowadays, many offices gave work from home opportunities to their employees, this is also a beautiful phase of life so enjoy it with full acceptance and this online life will end soon so make most out of it.</p>, <p>Hoping we will have a fresh breeze in New year 2021 with all positive approaches and value our environment with a clean atmosphere and hope all are following safety measures with their family in terms of not travelling to distant locations, wearing a mask whenever you go out or around people’s, washing your hands frequently. This small safety measures can end this Covid situation soon and help us to reach our routine life soon.</p>, <p>Hope everyone have a blessed and happy new year 2021!</p>]"
Go to I often wonder what we have done to deserve this authority,"[<p>We, humans, feel like the highest authority on earth who decides who is to be free and who is to be locked. I often wonder what we have done to deserve this authority. Those beautiful creatures especially lions, tigers and elephants deserve a better place- the wilderness to dwell.</p>, <p>First, we took their homes, cut down the trees and burned them and then en-caged them. Tyranny, I call it. Why do we go or take our children to the zoo? Don’t tell me for educational purposes, there is no education to be found in the zoo. All you find there is pain, sadness, torture and death. Watching a documentary at home will give you a better education and when you feel like seeing one, go in the wilderness and watch them when they are free, happy and active.</p>, <p>In the meantime, you will also get a chance to connect to nature and enjoy the true essence of life. Now when you look at this powerful image, change your perspective and view it from the eyes of the animal as if humans were the one en-caged, that might help to clarify things. Every creature deserves freedom; Imagine ourselves behind the glass, tough! Isn’t it? Animals are not a mere source of amusement and no we are not the highest authority, the earth is theirs too, as much as it’s ours.</p>]"
Go to Waste is wealth: A potential opportunity,"[<p>Human beings are the prime destroyers of the habitation while other living beings are contributors of the same.</p>, <p>What have we done our habitat:<br/>
With the discovery of fire and wheel, civilisations began to rise. The living standards, food habits changed gradually with scientific discoveries, inventions and technology. Subsequently, we began to generate waste and discarded it in our backyards and it has grown into mountains of garbage becoming hazardous to all living beings.</p>, <p>The menace: Plastic has become one of the worst pollutant problems in the world – an invention by man. The plastic waste fills garbage dumps, slumps, city streets, beaches, rivers, our forests and increasingly larger areas of our oceans. We use them once for a few minutes and throw them away. It causes major harm to our environment, our wildlife, our marine life and even to humans. Single-use plastic is a huge problem. When dumped openly there is land pollution, water pollution if dumped in wetlands, low lying areas and air pollution if burnt.</p>, <p>Year 2020: Invasion of coronavirus doomed our planet. With a war-like situation, the entire human race is affected and cornered, and no country can extend help to others. Covid-19 has stopped everything – our super being nature is shattered, human knowledge of medical sciences and technology failed to find clues of the virus, lakhs of lives are lost and the economy is badly affected across the globe. Nobody knows what is next. In the present context, one thing is noticeable that no other living organism is at risk of the Covid-19 virus, except humans beings.</p>, <p>Why? Maybe the Almighty is trying to control our dreadful activities to save his marvel creations.</p>, <p>Time for action:<br/>
Our nation is on the verge of becoming the most populated country in the world. Considering the population explosion is a primary factor, it is directly proportional to the amount of waste generation. Waste generated has not only laid a burden on the resources of the nation but has also become a threat to the health, safety and environment of the nation. If the improper treatment of MSW and dumping persists, soon the whole country will be a witness to a disaster. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to address this problem at the grass-root level.</p>, <p>The central government has put “clean India” at the top of its agenda. The Swachh Bharat Mission 2014 – one of the flagship program of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the most popular mission was also launched by the government. It has taught us to keep our country clean. However, we now need to be ‘Clean As Well As Green’ that is why SWACHH BHARAT MISSION – 2.0 – ZERO LANDFILL is need of the hour.</p>, <p>Across India, citizen movements against the waste have expanded day-by-day for cleaning up. People living in villages and cities are saying they do not want garbage to be disposed of in their vicinity – Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) is the slogan.</p>, <p>The way forward:<br/>
The technology for waste disposal is not a problem. Ensuring a zero-landfill future has to be the aim of a re-invented waste management system.</p>, <p>SEGREGATION: Segregation is a necessary first for the best use of available waste management disposal technology.</p>, <p>Awareness and Attitudes: Public awareness and attitudes toward waste can affect the entire SWM system. All steps in SWM- from household waste storage to waste segregation, recycling, collection frequency, amount of littering, willingness to pay for services, and opposition to the setting of treatment plants and disposal facilities-depend on public awareness and participation.<br/>
The practice of keeping multiple dustbins at every household and the commercial establishment is necessary. This will encourage segregation at the source. Thus, educating waste generators so that they can play a role in reducing, reusing and recycling are crucial to the success or failure of SWM system.</p>, <p>AN IDEA: SWACHH BHARAT MISSION 2.0<br/>
Climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emission at landfill areas have made SWM one of the most pressing environmental challenges globally as well as locally. Challenges are many like lack of funding to address the Municipal Solid Waste problem. There is a huge shortage of workers and an insufficient number of professionals in the field of waste management technology.<br/>
Research and Development: We need to empower our universities, engineering colleges – both governments funded and private – to promote research and enable them to improve research infrastructure. Universities and colleges, IITs and engineering colleges are to be given tasks with responsibilities to develop realistic models of solutions to his towering problem (Other issues like flood and river erosion, landslides, drinking water, conservation of groundwater, carbon-free air, etc). Robotics, satellite technology and environmental sciences may be integrated for better solutions for SWM problem.</p>, <p>A NEWER APPROACH OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT:<br/>
The field of Solid Waste Management has to be projected and designed as an emerging new career and an exceptional profession, this notion can solve unemployment in our country to a larger extent and finally eradicate the problem of landfill hazards henceforth. Modern Indian society as well as the government has to support to give recognition, a status to workers and professionals working in this field of waste management technology (Environmentalist, Innovators, Young researchers, mechanical and technical experts, NGOs, waste collectors, drivers, rag pickers the entire chain of man-power of Solid Waste Management).<br/>
Unless it is recognized as a lucrative profession, youths of the country will never join in this venture. It could be a revolutionary approach in tackling two problems together – unemployment and the task of ending landfill hazards.</p>, <p>Many civilizations collapsed and many nations failed because they did not have the vision at the right time. Union government at topmost priority must tackle the problem SWM with an approach of sustainable and integrated solid waste management. There are so many pioneers of this clean mission in India with excellent models of MSWM, those innovations, suggestions and ideas may be put together. The government should pass strict instructions to industries and companies for the disposal method of their product after use in TV commercials &amp; advertisements and promos.</p>, <p>Municipalities and local authorities &amp; bodies cannot tackle this task of SWM alone; it is an arrow shot in the dark. The government can create a department with separate budgetary head and allocation for research, technology, employment, timely implementation and execution of projects so that the state governments may also tackle this problem in the short-term and long-term courses.</p>, <p>Only then, our neighbourhood will be clean, green and a better place to live, which we have to hand over to the generations to come.</p>]"
