1,Mining Taking Place on More Than 20 Percent of Indigenous Land in the Amazon,"[<p>Mining activities — both large-scale legal concessions and smaller illegal operations — now cover more than 20 percent of Indigenous lands in the Amazon, accounting for 450,00 square kilometers, according to a new report by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the Amazon Geo-Referenced Socio-Environmental Information Network.
</p>, <p>In total, mining is taking place within 1,131 of the Amazon’s 3,653 Indigenous lands, excluding French Guiana and Suriname. Illegal mining, specifically, is affecting at least 370 Indigenous lands, the vast majority of which is occurring in Peru. The report also found that the industry is polluting or using for transit at least 30 Amazonian rivers, which run through or border 88 Indigenous lands.</p>, <p>The presence of mining was also associated with higher tree loss. Indigenous areas with mining activity in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru had forest loss at least three times higher than areas without. In Colombia and Venezuela, tree loss was one to two times higher.</p>, <p>“Despite growing evidence that Indigenous peoples are among the world’s greatest environmental stewards, our paper confirms what Amazonian Indigenous leaders have been telling us for years,” Peter Veit, coauthor of the report and director of WRI’s Land and Resource Rights Initiative, said in a statement.</p>, <p>“Across the Amazon, Indigenous territories are under siege from mining, both legal and illegal, and these activities are eroding communities’ ability to protect themselves, prevent deforestation and safeguard ecosystems that are essential to the planet’s well-being.”</p>]"
2,New Super-Enzyme Can Break Down Plastic at Rapid Pace,"[<p>A super-enzyme that degrades plastic bottles six times faster than before has been created by scientists and could be used for recycling within a year or two. The super-enzyme, derived from bacteria that naturally evolved the ability to eat plastic, enables the full recycling of the bottles.
</p>, <p>Scientists believe combining it with enzymes that break down cotton could also allow mixed-fabric clothing to be recycled. Today, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/britons-expected-to-send-235m-items-of-clothing-to-landfill-this-spring"">millions of tonnes</a> of such clothing is either dumped in landfills or incinerated.
</p>, <p>Plastic pollution has contaminated the whole planet, from the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/14/microplastics-found-at-profuse-levels-in-snow-from-arctic-to-alps-contamination"">Arctic</a> to the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean"">deepest oceans</a>, and people are now known to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/people-eat-at-least-50000-plastic-particles-a-year-study-finds"">consume</a> and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/27/revealed-microplastic-pollution-is-raining-down-on-city-dwellers"">breathe</a> microplastic particles. It is currently very difficult to break down plastic bottles into their chemical constituents in order to make new ones from old, meaning more new plastic is being created from oil each year.
</p>, <p>The super-enzyme was engineered by linking two separate enzymes, both of which were found in the plastic-eating bug discovered at a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge"">Japanese waste site in 2016</a>. The researchers revealed an engineered version of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles?CMP=share_btn_tw"">first enzyme in 2018</a>, which started breaking down the plastic in a few days. But the super-enzyme gets to work six times faster.
</p>, <p>“When we linked the enzymes, rather unexpectedly, we got a dramatic increase in activity,“ said John McGeehan, at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. “This is a trajectory towards trying to make faster enzymes that are more industrially relevant. But it’s also one of those stories about learning from nature, and then bringing it into the lab.”
</p>, <p>French company <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/scientists-create-mutant-enzyme-that-recycles-plastic-bottles-in-hours"">Carbios revealed a different enzyme in April</a>, originally discovered in a compost heap of leaves, that degrades 90 percent of plastic bottles within 10 hours, but requires heating above 70 degrees Celsius.
</p>, <p>The new super-enzyme works at room temperature, and McGeehan said combining different approaches could speed progress towards commercial use: “If we can make better, faster enzymes by linking them together and provide them to companies like Carbios, and work in partnership, we could start doing this within the next year or two.”
</p>, <p>The 2018 work had determined that the structure of one enzyme, called PETase, can attack the hard, crystalline surface of plastic bottles. They found, by accident, that one mutant version worked 20 percent faster. The new study analyzed a second enzyme also found in the Japanese bacteria that doubles the speed of the breakdown of the chemical groups liberated by the first enzyme.
</p>, <p>Bacteria that break down natural polymers like cellulose have evolved this twin approach over millions of years. The scientists thought by connecting the two enzymes together, it might increase the speed of degradation, and enable them to work more closely together.
</p>, <p>The linked super-enzyme would be impossible for a bacterium to create, as the molecule would be too large. So the scientists connected the two enzymes in the laboratory and saw a further tripling of the speed. The new research by scientists at the University of Portsmouth and four US institutions is published in the journal <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006753117"">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.
</p>, <p>The team is now examining how the enzymes can be tweaked to make them work even faster still. “There’s huge potential,” said McGeehan. “We’ve got several hundred in the lab that we’re currently sticking together.” A £1 million testing center is now being built in Portsmouth and Carbios is currently building a plant in Lyon.
</p>, <p>Combining the plastic-eating enzymes with existing ones that break down natural fibers could allow mixed materials to be fully recycled, McGeehan said. “Mixed fabrics [of polyester and cotton] are really tricky to recycle. We’ve been speaking to some of the big fashion companies that produce these textiles, because they’re really struggling at the moment.”
</p>, <p>Campaigners say reducing the use of plastic is key. Those working on recycling say that strong, lightweight materials like plastic are very useful and that true recycling is part of the solution to the pollution problem.
</p>, <p>Researchers have also been successful in finding <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/scientists-find-bug-that-feasts-on-toxic-plastic"">bugs that eat other plastics such as polyurethane</a>, which is widely used but rarely recycled. When polyurethane breaks down it can release toxic chemicals that would kill most bacteria, but the bug identified actually uses the material as food to power the process.

3,"As Climate Impacts Worsen, Homeowners Struggle to Find Affordable Insurance","[<p>Insurance is getting harder for some U.S. homeowners to obtain as a result of the impacts of climate change, according to reporting from <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/home-insurance-climate-change_l_5f721262c5b6e99dc3306840?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=96363053&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ZpQSydo8TvwmScbs4nDutFwAXVmx5DnZwkLDk1hK-l2XQXVFgZgKr6gzNxGuXiEQM5dJ0jlVqZanNiUJ--nfV7hZsswiEyBXJyqdkizjjpljHQyc&amp;utm_content=96363053&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;guccounter=1"">The Huffington Post</a> and <a href=""https://www.marketplace.org/2020/08/31/insurance-increasingly-unaffordable-as-climate-change-brings-more-disasters/"">Marketplace</a>. Many insurance companies are choosing not to renew homeowner policies in areas with increased risks of wildfires, sea level rise, or other natural disasters, or are significantly raising premiums.
</p>, <p>“The insurance industry’s ability to assess the prospective risks a property faces has improved dramatically,” Michael Barry, head of media and public affairs for the <a href=""https://www.iii.org/"">Insurance Information Institute</a>, told The Huffington Post.</p>, <p>According to a <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-companies-climate-change-risk.html"">2019 survey</a> of insurance companies by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, more than half of insurance regulators said “that climate change was likely to have a high impact or an extremely high impact on coverage availability and underwriting assumptions.”</p>, <p>From 2017 to 2018, the number of homeowner policies not renewed by insurance companies jumped 6 percent in areas of California with a high risk of wildfire. In areas where fires occurred, nonrenewals increased 10 percent from 2015 to 2017. Similar upticks have occurred in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, areas hard hit by hurricanes and flooding. As a result, many homeowners are turning to bare-bone plans, such as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, which can cost double or triple normal insurance policies.</p>, <p>“Affordability of home insurance in the face of climate change has become a huge issue in many states,” Amy Bach, executive director of the nonprofit <a href=""https://www.uphelp.org/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">United Policyholders</a>, recently told Minnesota Public Radio’s Marketplace. “Home insurance now is costing more in areas that are vulnerable to climate change, is harder to find, and is worth less.”</p>]"
4,Human Activity is Increasing Severity and Frequency of Major Marine Heatwaves,"[<p>Marine heatwaves have become more than 20 times more frequent over the past 40 years due to human activity and the burning of greenhouse gases, according to a <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/1621"">new study published in the journal <em>Science</em></a>. The research is the first to analyze the anthropogenic impacts on marine heatwaves, and points to the need for ambitious climate action.
</p>, <p>The research, led by marine scientists at the University of Bern in Switzerland, examined satellite measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1981 to 2017. It found that marine heatwaves have become much longer, hotter, and more frequent. In the 1980s, satellites recorded 27 major marine heatwaves, each of which lasted about a month with water temperatures reaching a maximum 4.8 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above average. In the past decade, however, there were 172 major marine heatwaves across the globe, lasting 48 days on average with peak temperatures of 5.5 Celsius above average.</p>, <p>A widespread heatwave in the Pacific Ocean, for example, often referred to as “the blob,” increased sea surface temperatures in that region by more than 2.5 degrees C between 2013 and 2015.</p>, <p>Heatwaves can have lasting impacts on marine species, ecosystems, and economies. The high temperatures can trigger algal blooms, impact nutrient availability, cause mass coral bleaching, and alter fish migration patterns. Oceans “need a long time to recover afterwards — if they ever fully recover,” Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern and lead author of the new study, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200925113351.htm"">said in a statement</a>.</p>, <p>In pre-industrial times, extreme marine heatwaves similar to those seen in the last decade would have only occurred once every few hundred to thousands of years. But Laufkötter and her colleagues found that if global temperatures rise 1.5 degrees Celsius — the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, requiring aggressive and immediate climate action — such marine heatwaves could happen once a decade or century. If temperatures increase by 3 degrees C, marine heat waves could become as frequent as once a year or decade.</p>, <p>“Ambitious climate goals are an absolute necessity for reducing the risk of unprecedented marine heatwaves,” said Laufkötter. “They are the only way to prevent the irreversible loss of some of the most valuable marine ecosystems.”</p>]"
5,The World’s Largest Wind Turbines to Be Used for North Sea Project,"[<p>The world’s largest offshore wind project — the 3.6-gigawatt Dogger Bank farm in the North Sea — <a href=""https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-renewable-energy-haliade-x-turbines-be-used-dogger-bank-wind-farms#:~:text=Press%20Release-,GE%20Renewable%20Energy's%20Haliade-X%20turbines%20to%20be,by%20Dogger%20Bank%20Wind%20Farms&amp;text=Dogger%20Bank%20will%20now%20be,become%20carbon%20neutral%20by%202050.%E2%80%9D"">announced</a> it will be using the world’s largest turbines to generate electricity for more than 4.5 million homes in the United Kingdom, <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/worlds-biggest-wind-farm-will-boast-worlds-largest-installed-turbines"">Greentech Media reported</a>. The 13-megawatt (MW) turbines, built by General Electric, stand more than 850 feet tall, five times the size of the Arc de Triomphe.
</p>, <p>Located off the coast of Yorkshire, England, the $10-billion Dogger Bank project is being developed in three phases, the first two of which will use the 13-megawatt version of GE’s Haliade-X platform. The turbine’s blades measure longer than a <a href=""https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-announces-haliade-x-worlds-most-powerful-offshore-wind-turbine#:~:text=Towering%20260%20meters%20over%20the,carries%20a%20220-meter%20rotor"">soccer field</a> (351 feet), and GE claims that a single rotation can supply enough electricity to power the average British household for two days. When the wind farm is complete in 2026, it will generate 5 percent of the United Kingdom’s electricity.
</p>, <p>Dogger Bank’s order for 190 turbines arrived the same day that GE announced it will no longer supply power equipment to new coal plants.

6,Ecuador’s Highest Court Will Allow Communities to Vote on Mining Projects,"[<p>Ecuador’s Constitutional Court has ruled that communities have the right to vote on whether to allow large and medium-sized mining projects in their areas, the industry news site <a href=""https://www.mining.com/ecuador-allows-communities-to-decide-mining-projects-fate/"">Mining.com reported</a>. The legal decision will apply only to new projects, not those already licensed.
</p>, <p>The decision follows a petition by the Ecuadorian city of Cuenca to allow a ballot referendum on mining near water sources, including near the Tomebamba, Machángara, Norcay, Yanuncay, and Tarqui rivers. Cuenca is located in the province of Azuay, which is home to extensive reserves of gold, silver, and copper and several major mining projects, including SolGold’s Sharug project, INV Metals’ Loma Larga mine, and the Rio Blanco mine, owned by a consortium of Chinese companies.</p>, <p>Experts say the new referendum could complicate President Lenín Moreno’s efforts to <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-mining/mineral-rich-ecuadorean-province-requests-popular-referendum-on-mining-idUSKCN1UP2CN"">expand Ecuador’s mining industry</a>, including his administration’s goal of attracting $3.7 billion in new investments over the next two years.</p>, <p>“It has been a dream for Cuencans for so many years to be allowed, through popular consultation, to determine the future protection of our water sources,” Cuenca Mayor Pedro Palacios <a href=""https://www.expreso.ec/actualidad/primera-segunda-vuelta-incluiria-consulta-popular-actividad-minera-cuenca-90420.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">told local media</a>.

7,Could New Fungi-Based Leather Replace the Real Thing?,"[<p>Scientists have found that new faux-leather textiles made from fungi look, feel, and are as durable as leather made from cows or synthetic fabrics, according to a new study published in the journal <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00606-1""><em>Nature Sustainability</em></a>. The research supports claims made by companies in Korea, Indonesia, and the United States that fungi-derived leather is a competitive, sustainable option for the clothing industry.
</p>, <p>The new material uses agricultural and forestry byproducts, such as sawdust, to grow “chitinous polymers and other polysaccharides” that form into mats of mycelium, the underlying root networks of fungi. From there, the material is altered physically and chemically to visually resemble leather and exhibit comparable properties.
</p>, <p>“It feels a bit and smells a bit like mushroom, but it looks like a piece of old leather jacket,” Alexander Bismarck, a materials scientist at the University of Vienna and coauthor of the new study, told <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/science/fungus-leather.html""><em>The New York Times</em></a>. 
</p>, <p>According to the study, this fungal leather material is not only renewable and biodegradable, but it also does not depend on the livestock industry and eliminates the need for toxic tanning chemicals. It is part of an emerging market of ethically and environmentally responsible fabrics that fits into the circular economy, which aims to eliminate waste and promote the continual use of resources.
</p>, <p>Another advantage of this type of leather is its ability to be customized and grown to specifications. 
</p>, <p>Companies like <a href=""https://www.mycoworks.com/"">MycoWorks</a> and <a href=""https://boltthreads.com/"">Bolt Threads</a> have been manufacturing and selling fungal leather products for several years at prices competitive with authentic leather goods. And costs are likely to drop as interest and manufacturing capacity increases.
</p>, <p>“There’s already massive mushroom cultivation industries that are producing all kinds of mushrooms for the culinary market,” Mitchell Jones, a materialis scientists from the Vienna University of Technology and lead author of the study, told <em>The New York Times</em>. “The technology to mass produce mushrooms is already there.”

8,Scientists Report Mass Migratory Bird Deaths in U.S. and Mexico,"[<p>Scientists and birdwatchers are reporting a mass die-off of migratory birds across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, several news outlets reported. From flycatchers to swallows to warblers, researchers estimate hundreds of thousands to possibly up to a million birds have died in recent weeks. Scientists say they are unsure of the exact reasons for the deaths.
</p>, <p>Avian ecologist Martha Desmond, of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, called the die-off “unprecedented.”</p>, <p>“It’s enormous, the extent of this,” <a href=""https://www.audubon.org/news/the-southwest-facing-unprecedented-migratory-bird-die"">Desmond told Audubon</a>. “We haven’t counted all the species yet, but there are lots of species involved.”</p>, <p>Online reports show mass deaths in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, and as far north as Nebraska, as well as in four states in Mexico, and include migratory species as varied as owls, hummingbirds, loons, and woodpeckers, many of which were migrating south to wintering grounds.</p>, <p>Many of the dead birds have <a href=""https://twitter.com/salasphorus/status/1304973069056786432"">little fat reserves or muscle mass remaining</a>, and some seem to have literally dropped from the sky mid-flight. Scientists recorded the first group of deaths on August 20 in White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Researchers suspect that months of extremely dry conditions, combined with unseasonably cold weather in the Southwest, could have triggered an early start to this year’s migrations before some species were physically ready to make the arduous trip thousands of miles south. But now, as the deaths have continued, researchers say smoke from the ongoing wildfires in California, Oregon, and Washington could also be playing a role.</p>, <p>“It could be a combination of things. It could be something that’s still completely unknown to us,” Allison Salas, a graduate student at New Mexico State University, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/16/birds-falling-out-of-the-sky-in-mass-die-off-in-south-western-us-aoe"">told <em>The Guardian</em></a>. “The fact that we’re finding hundreds of these birds dying, just kind of falling out of the sky is extremely alarming … The volume of carcasses that we have found has literally given me chills.” </p>, <p>The dead birds are being analyzed by scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service forensics lab in Oregon and the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin.

9,"The Arctic Is Shifting to a New Climate State, Scientists Find","[<p>The Arctic is transitioning from a frozen region to an entirely different climate, one dominated not by ice and snow, but by warming temperatures, open water, and rain, scientists warned in a <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0892-z"">new study</a> published in the journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em>.
</p>, <p>“The rate of change is remarkable,” Laura Landrum, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the lead author of the study, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200914112232.htm"">said in a statement</a>. “It’s a period of such rapid change that observations of past weather patterns no longer show what you can expect next year. The Arctic is already entering a completely different climate than just a few decades ago… We need to change our definition of what Arctic climate is.”</p>, <p>The study found that sea ice has melted so extensively —shrinking 12 percent per decade since satellite measurements began in the late 1970s — that even an unusually cold year will not produce the same ice extent seen in the middle of the 20th century. Fall and winter air temperatures will warm enough to officially classify the Arctic as a different climate zone within the next few decades, causing more precipitation to fall as rain and not snow. The region may become mostly ice-free for as many as 10 months each year by the end of the century.</p>, <p>The scientists used high-emissions scenarios in their climate modeling, which they say provides a bit of hope that aggressive climate action by nations could help curb some of the worst impacts.</p>, <p>“We still have an opportunity to change how rapidly the Arctic evolves,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/climate/arctic-changing-climate.html"">Landrum told <em>The New York Times</em></a>, “if we end up changing our emissions.”</p>, <p>“You can’t just give up.
