Today, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/apr/06/britons-expected-to-send-235m-items-of-clothing-to-landfill-this-spring\">millions of tonnes of such clothing is either dumped in landfills or incinerated.\n",

It is currently very difficult to break down plastic bottles into their chemical constituents in order to make new ones from old, meaning more new plastic is being created from oil each year.\n",
       ", The super-enzyme was engineered by linking two separate enzymes, both of which were found in the plastic-eating bug discovered at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/could-a-new-plastic-eating-bacteria-help-combat-this-pollution-scourge\">Japanese waste site in 2016. The researchers revealed an engineered version of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/scientists-accidentally-create-mutant-enzyme-that-eats-plastic-bottles?CMP=share_btn_tw\">first enzyme in 2018, which started breaking down the plastic in a few days. But the super-enzyme gets to work six times faster.\n",
       ", “When we linked the enzymes, rather unexpectedly, we got a dramatic increase in activity,“ said John McGeehan, at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom. “This is a trajectory towards trying to make faster enzymes that are more industrially relevant. But it’s also one of those stories about learning from nature, and then bringing it into the lab.”\n",
       ", French company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/scientists-create-mutant-enzyme-that-recycles-plastic-bottles-in-hours\">Carbios revealed a different enzyme in April, originally discovered in a compost heap of leaves, that degrades 90 percent of plastic bottles within 10 hours, but requires heating above 70 degrees Celsius.\n",
       ", The new super-enzyme works at room temperature, and McGeehan said combining different approaches could speed progress towards commercial use: “If we can make better, faster enzymes by linking them together and provide them to companies like Carbios, and work in partnership, we could start doing this within the next year or two.”\n",
       ", The 2018 work had determined that the structure of one enzyme, called PETase, can attack the hard, crystalline surface of plastic bottles. They found, by accident, that one mutant version worked 20 percent faster. The new study analyzed a second enzyme also found in the Japanese bacteria that doubles the speed of the breakdown of the chemical groups liberated by the first enzyme.\n",
       ", Bacteria that break down natural polymers like cellulose have evolved this twin approach over millions of years. The scientists thought by connecting the two enzymes together, it might increase the speed of degradation, and enable them to work more closely together.\n",
       ", The linked super-enzyme would be impossible for a bacterium to create, as the molecule would be too large. So the scientists connected the two enzymes in the laboratory and saw a further tripling of the speed. The new research by scientists at the University of Portsmouth and four US institutions is published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006753117\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",
       ", The team is now examining how the enzymes can be tweaked to make them work even faster still. “There’s huge potential,” said McGeehan. “We’ve got several hundred in the lab that we’re currently sticking together.” A £1 million testing center is now being built in Portsmouth and Carbios is currently building a plant in Lyon.\n",
       ", Combining the plastic-eating enzymes with existing ones that break down natural fibers could allow mixed materials to be fully recycled, McGeehan said. “Mixed fabrics [of polyester and cotton] are really tricky to recycle. We’ve been speaking to some of the big fashion companies that produce these textiles, because they’re really struggling at the moment.”\n",
       ", Campaigners say reducing the use of plastic is key. Those working on recycling say that strong, lightweight materials like plastic are very useful and that true recycling is part of the solution to the pollution problem.\n",
       ", Researchers have also been successful in finding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/scientists-find-bug-that-feasts-on-toxic-plastic\">bugs that eat other plastics such as polyurethane, which is widely used but rarely recycled. When polyurethane breaks down it can release toxic chemicals that would kill most bacteria, but the bug identified actually uses the material as food to power the process.\n",

       ", “The insurance industry’s ability to assess the prospective risks a property faces has improved dramatically,” Michael Barry, head of media and public affairs for the <a href=\"https://www.iii.org/\">Insurance Information Institute, told The Huffington Post., According to a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/insurance-companies-climate-change-risk.html\">2019 survey of insurance companies by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services, more than half of insurance regulators said “that climate change was likely to have a high impact or an extremely high impact on coverage availability and underwriting assumptions.”, From 2017 to 2018, the number of homeowner policies not renewed by insurance companies jumped 6 percent in areas of California with a high risk of wildfire. In areas where fires occurred, nonrenewals increased 10 percent from 2015 to 2017. Similar upticks have occurred in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, areas hard hit by hurricanes and flooding. As a result, many homeowners are turning to bare-bone plans, such as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, which can cost double or triple normal insurance policies., “Affordability of home insurance in the face of climate change has become a huge issue in many states,” Amy Bach, executive director of the nonprofit <a href=\"https://www.uphelp.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">United Policyholders, recently told Minnesota Public Radio’s Marketplace. “Home insurance now is costing more in areas that are vulnerable to climate change, is harder to find, and is worth less.”</td>\n",

The research is the first to analyze the anthropogenic impacts on marine heatwaves, and points to the need for ambitious climate action.\n",
       ", The research, led by marine scientists at the University of Bern in Switzerland, examined satellite measurements of sea surface temperatures from 1981 to 2017. It found that marine heatwaves have become much longer, hotter, and more frequent. In the 1980s, satellites recorded 27 major marine heatwaves, each of which lasted about a month with water temperatures reaching a maximum 4.8 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above average. In the past decade, however, there were 172 major marine heatwaves across the globe, lasting 48 days on average with peak temperatures of 5.5 Celsius above average., A widespread heatwave in the Pacific Ocean, for example, often referred to as “the blob,” increased sea surface temperatures in that region by more than 2.5 degrees C between 2013 and 2015., Heatwaves can have lasting impacts on marine species, ecosystems, and economies. The high temperatures can trigger algal blooms, impact nutrient availability, cause mass coral bleaching, and alter fish migration patterns. Oceans “need a long time to recover afterwards — if they ever fully recover,” Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern and lead author of the new study, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200925113351.htm\">said in a statement., In pre-industrial times, extreme marine heatwaves similar to those seen in the last decade would have only occurred once every few hundred to thousands of years. But Laufkötter and her colleagues found that if global temperatures rise 1.5 degrees Celsius — the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, requiring aggressive and immediate climate action — such marine heatwaves could happen once a decade or century. If temperatures increase by 3 degrees C, marine heat waves could become as frequent as once a year or decade., “Ambitious climate goals are an absolute necessity for reducing the risk of unprecedented marine heatwaves,” said Laufkötter. “They are the only way to prevent the irreversible loss of some of the most valuable marine ecosystems.”</td>\n",

It wasn’t until late January that it finally became household news on mainstream news channels. Looking more closely at some of the earliest mentions of the outbreak, the details emerging in the first days of January were strongly suggestive of a serious health threat despite receiving little to no media attention in most of the countries in the world., Until January 2020, Corona to me meant “the rarefied gaseous envelope of the sun and other stars. The sun’s corona is normally visible only during a total solar eclipse when it is seen as an irregularly shaped pearly glow surrounding the darkened disc of the moon”, But soon after that, I realized the magnitude and strength of the word “Corona”. Now the World realizes this Crown does not bring glory to the wearer but on the contrary, threatens to take away the most precious God’s gift of life., I am a believer of Hindu philosophy, I strongly believe in Karma….I understand the Compound effect of the action. The last time CO2 was this high in the Earth’s atmosphere, Humans didn’t exist., Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world’s seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now., As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where we’re rapidly headed now., The question was – is this pandemic God’s way of warning us to take care of our activities?, When humans fail to take actions, nature emerges and corrects itself.. remember Nature’s Law Of Balance., No war, no recession, no previous pandemic has had such a dramatic impact on emissions of CO2 over the past century as Covid-19 has in a few short months. Multiple sources indicate we are now living through an unrivalled drop in carbon output., My faith in the Teachings of Gita only grew stronger—wherein it states in the Equality of all beings. The virus does not discriminate, from President Donald Trump to a small peasant, the situation has shown us that we are all the same regardless of our religion, culture, customs, whether we are poor or rich. The virus simply does not choose., As manifested by Lord Krishna himself: “My true devotee does not feel hatred for any being, but is friendly and compassionate towards all, without the thoughts of I-and-mine” We simply cannot live without relationships. This pandemic has taught me all about compassion, sharing and caring., I am understanding my life for the better. The lockdown period has given me time to retrospect, what I want from my life to where I am taking myself to. This period has helped me find my self and my purpose in life., I now understand the real meaning of Happiness. Happiness is not in materialistic pleasure, achieving big things which you enjoy alone, but it is in small things in life you share with other people., I have emerged from here, I will now not wait for bad to happen, I already appreciate what nature has given me. I am conserving happiness from every small thing that God has given me. I am doing things which I have always wanted to do earlier, but couldn’t do because of the proximity of time and things like that. I realize that reading a book with a cup of coffee makes me happy. I have realized, how working together at home, doing work like washing, cooking, mopping and things like that gives me immense pleasure because I am with my Family., The utmost important life lesson learnt is:” Life is precious, live every day to its fullest, I know obstacles will come, but I have learnt to overcome them. I am living each day, enjoying my life and appreciating what I have. In doing so not one day I have Lost my Faith in HIM., The best thing is that I have started believing in The Power Of Magic and Faith even more</td>\n",

The lockdown initially shut down major economic activities except for essential services. Every activity whether economic, social, political or legal was affected in the fight against the invisible. As on date, people are adapting to the new normal in terms of the rules and regulations that have been put in place to prevent the spread of COVID- 19., With winter approaching comes, the rise in air pollution levels in Delhi NCR region. There are various factors like Open dumping and burning of garbage, Road dust, Unpaved roads, demolition and construction sites, an overly populated city with traffic congestion, etc., which contribute to the winter smog in Delhi but also these put aside, there remains one major contributor to air pollution namely the practice of Stubble Burning by farmers. Stubble Burning is a practice followed by the farmers where they set fire to the crop residue in order to eliminate the same. Despite various decisions of the Courts and Tribunals, regulations by the Government, the farmers continue their practice of burning stubble every year. One may blame lack of technology in India or they lack knowledge of such technology amongst farmers but is that a reasonable explanation to put so many human beings residing within the State of NCT of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh at the risk of developing ailments on account of poor air quality due to the practice of Stubble Burning. Also, can such violation of the right to clean air as stands protected within the purview the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution be allowed, only on the pretext that the farmers do not have an adequate amount of time to clear the stubble from their fields and for they find it convenient to set the stubble to fire., In the year 2018, National Green Tribunal (NGT), New Delhi took cognizance on some of the newspaper reports indicating excessive crop residue burning in Smt. Ganga Lalwani V. Union of India and Ors. The National Green Tribunal directed Chief Secretaries of States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi to communicate to the court a strategic plan and action to prevent crop residue burning. The Government of India and the State Governments tried to implement some mechanisms to prevent the farmers from indulging into stubble burning activities. But even last year the farmers burnt the crop residue which resulted in unsafe Air Quality Index in and around Delhi NCR region., Taking cognizance of the poor management of the problems relating to stubble burning by the Government, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on 04.11.2019 stepped in to hold the Government and Government bodies responsible for the health hazard caused due to stubble burning. The Hon’ble Court while taking cognizance of the level of pollution in Delhi and NCR region observed that<em> “There cannot be large scale exodus. People have to perform their duty in Delhi also and people cannot be evacuated from Delhi being a capital city. We are at a loss to understand why we are not able to create a situation in which this kind of pollution does not take place, that too in a routine manner every year. Obviously, it is writ large that the State Governments, Government of NCT of Delhi and civic bodies have miserably failed to discharge their liability as per the directive principles of State Policy which have found statutory expression, they are being made statutory mockery and also the directions of this Court and High Courts in this regard are being violated with impunity.”</em> The Hon’ble Supreme Court fixed the liability of the State and State Authorities to ensure that the farmers are made aware of their responsibility and liability towards other human beings so that they desist from stubble burning in future. The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed stubble burning to be a situation destroying the right to life itself., Today, when the country is recovering from the economic impact of the pandemic, are the State Governments prepared enough to ensure that no stubble burning takes place this year. Unlike last year any further shutting down of construction activities or stoppage of coal-based industries, other industries will have a long-lasting impact on the revival of the economic conditions of the country. The stoppage of the functioning of economic activities on account of stubble burning this year will have serious financial implications for the industries as well as the individuals employed in these industries as every individual today is struggling to recover from the blows of the unforeseeable pandemic. Hence, in these circumstances where the citizens of the country are already facing harsh economic conditions due to loss of job and salary cuts, shutting down of any economic operations to curb the ill-effects of stubble burning will put the people under the sword., On the 01.10.2020, the Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar held a meeting with State Environment Ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the secretaries of pollution control boards and representatives from Delhi Development Authority and New Delhi Municipal Council to check the preparedness of the State machinery and the proposed preventive measures which could be put into place to prevent crop residue burning during this winter season. The Union Minister said that this year a new technology developed by Pusa Agriculture Institute to decompose straw in the fields will be used in Delhi-NCR and in Uttar Pradesh (UP) as informed by the environment ministers of these States to prevent the farmers from burning crop residue, in addition to several other initiatives discussed by the participants of the meeting.  It is now imperative upon the State Governments to take sufficient and effective preventive steps to ensure that the farmers are made aware of the deleterious impact of stubble burning on human life. Further, it is also essential that the advanced technology as proposed by the State Governments reaches the farmers well within time so as to relieve the farmers of the hardship of clearing the stubble from their fields and also to protect the interests of all those who battle to breathe clean air in Delhi NCR and nearby regions during the winter season.

This consensus has been around for the past 10 years or so and is only growing stronger as technology helps scientists create more accurate models for understanding and predicting planetary shifts., What is causing climate change?, Causes are both natural and anthropogenic, but anthropogenic changes are disrupting more., We humans are the ones who burn fossil fuels and chopping down forests, causing average temperatures to rise worldwide. That global warming trend is increasingly disrupting our climate — the average weather over many years., Earth has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius, since the 19th century, before the industry started to boom., A warmer world — even by a half-degree Celsius — has more evaporation, leading to more water in the atmosphere. Such changing conditions put our agriculture, health, water supply and more at risk., A warming planet means glaciers and permafrost are melting at a high rate. Why does this matter? For one, more water creates more heat in the atmosphere. The melting permafrost releases additional greenhouse gases. As the oceans get hotter, they become more acidic, which harms sea creatures. As Arctic ice disappears, animals that depend on that landscape are becoming endangered. Glacial melting also reduces the world’s supply of freshwater, since they store about 75% of the world’s supply., There’s also a scientific belief that melting permafrost will release infectious diseases thought long-gone into human populations, threatening human health on a large scale., IPCC says: “A changing climate leads to changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events.”, Reasons why we need to worry :, WE ALL NEED CLEAN WATER, -2 in every 3 people worldwide live in regions of severe water. Even a small increase in global temperatures will destabilize the water cycle and could make water scarcity much worse. Climate change affects rainfall patterns, meaning both drought and flooding will be more common, and more intense., 2. WE ALL DESERVE TO BREATHE CLEAN AIR, With anthropogenic climate change driven by human-caused emissions to the atmosphere, it stands to reason that we face compromised air quality. This affects human health, especially children. Air pollution can lead to asthma, heart and lung disease., 3. WE ARE ALL AFFECTED, NO MATTER WHERE IN THE WORLD WE LIVE, Climate change won’t just impact forest, or coral reefs, or even people in far-off countries – it will affect all of us. From more extreme weather to increasing food prices, to recreation and decreased opportunities to appreciate the natural world, people everywhere will feel the effects of climate change., 4. FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS, We are so blessed to be living on such a beautiful planet, but if we look at the conditions and what all is happening, maybe future generations won’t be able to nurture the same., If you’re feeling worried by now, you’re not alone., We need to understand our responsibilities and work towards the betterment of our planet. No matter where you live, you will be affected, so start today, your journey towards green life., WE NEED THE EARTH, EARTH DOESN’T NEED US., TOGETHER WE CAN.</td>\n",

Hence, it is no brainer that changing energy use behaviours in these environments can lead to considerable carbon savings., The common barriers to any behaviour change are demographics, socio-cultural factors, economics, and internal factors such as motivations, values, knowledge, and priorities., There are many different behaviour change frameworks, but one of the most widely used and unified frameworks is Behavior Change Wheel or BCW., In BCW, behaviour change origins are divided into the “COM-B system,” which hypothesized that an individual’s Capability, the opportunity presented, and intrinsic Motivation comes together and generates behaviour., Here, Capability is the person’s psycho-physiological characteristics. Motivation is the inner cognitive processes, conscious or sub-conscious, which gives direction to the person. Furthermore, the opportunity is all the factors that come from outside., Now, how does BCW provides a structure that may help in influencing the workplace energy-saving behaviour?, The desired behaviour change, which is more energy-saving practices, can be achieved by influencing the Intervention functions, which are:, Education: Giving the employee information regarding the issue so that they can understand why it is necessary. E.g., the information about energy-saving actions, feedback on energy use, and building energy audit results., Persuasion: Influencing the feelings of employees to drive them to take action themselves. E.g., showing them graphs, tables, encouraging text, and images as we are more susceptible to be influenced by what we see., Incentivization: For making employees feel motivated to act, management makes some arrangements for awarding rewards. A study reported energy savings of 6.4% on public social rewards, and it also reported an increase in energy usage due to private monetary rewards., Coercion: Creating a belief that unwanted behaviour may have repercussions, such as raising the financial cost to reduce excessive electricity usage., Training: Imparting skills. With installing new smart energy technologies or systems, the building occupants derive some satisfaction when using the new system, and satisfaction gets achieved if they can use the system., Restriction: Imposing some form of regulations to reduce participation in the target behaviour., Environmental Restructuring: The physical or social setting in which the target behaviour is happening is changed, e.g., putting up regular prompts and signs or visual imagery on large TV screens as the act of giving information alone creates significantly less impact. A pilot research report study found that due to the employee being provided feedback by an energy generating console desk resulted in energy savings of 30%., Modelling: Giving people instances in which they can compare themselves to others. E.g., organizing competitions between colleagues, either individually or in groups, so that they can assess each other’s qualities. A year-long energy-saving campaign, which involved an online platform of information, a website, email reminders, and posters, generated 6.5% average energy savings per building., Enablement: This process incorporates giving someone the authority or means, which means reducing barriers and increasing means to do something. Around 35% of energy savings reported by two different studies conducted on enablement through the use of an energy console-desk that gave employees the authority to control electronic devices at their desks remotely., From the above framework and its components, we observed that apart from employing behaviour change programs targeting a person’s actions, it is also essential to have physical infrastructure and technologies to have an integrated successful reduction in energy usage. It is so because how technologies are accepted and seen by employees, their short- and long-term impacts, and their influence on employees’ willingness in energy savings is essential., According to a Scottish Government report, employing technology and infrastructural changes was the most profitable behaviour change strategy employed in the workplace for energy saving. Furthermore, employing technology changes, giving feedback to users, and activating the social norm was the most enabling strategy in delivering lasting changes on workplace energy-saving behaviours according to a report by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, UK., Hence, we can conclude that the result of various studies is that engaging employees in any energy-saving program at every stage, creating social and physical opportunities to save energy is the most successful strategy. It shows that employees are also facilitating changes, and their involvement is valued. The other influencing factors are social culture and existing organization dynamics for increasing employees’ motivations to act. The significance of social influence proven by a report showed that rewards and incentives given publicly are relatively more useful than when given privately., Furthermore, Managers and their attitudes play the central role because of the opportunities developed due to their energy usage decisions. Building owners who have rented the place can also accomplish sustainability goals by placing various energy-saving clauses in rental agreements.</td>\n",

For comparison, between 1950 and 2005, worldwide metals production grew six-fold, oil consumption eightfold, and natural gas consumption 14-fold. So, if we continue on the same path, our future generations will not have access to the resources the way that we have now. The harmful effects of our consumption and its final impact on the humankind are well known., Though production systems create material wealth for humans, they consume a great number of resources while generating a lot of waste. The waste generated during the production processes, during the use of the products and after the end of the life of the products is responsible for the degradation of the environment., Sustainable production can be defined as a method to maximize efficiency while minimizing waste and reduce environmental impact. The core of sustainable production is what happens on the factory floor. The tool mostly used to implement sustainable production is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA tries to gauge the environmental impact at various production stages starting from raw material acquisition to product use and final disposal. The choices we make affect the direction of sustainability., Sustainable production requires that all production organisations should aim for the following four activities, • Energy use reduction, • Water use reduction, • Emissions reduction, • Waste generation reduction, Sustainable Production example:, Cutting fluids are used extensively in metal machining processes to remove and reduce the heat during the machining operations. The use of cutting fluids greatly enhances the machining quality while reducing the cost of machining by extending tool life. However, the mist and vapour generated during the machining processes are harmful to the operator and stringent regulations exist to control them. Direct exposure of cutting fluids has been responsible for a number of skin cancer cases. Stringent environmental legislations require that the spent cutting fluids be recycled or disposed of in a manner that is not harmful to the environment. This calls for increased expenditure on the recycling and disposal procedures used depending upon the type of cutting fluid., The cost and environmental impact lead the researchers to find an alternative to the traditional cutting fluids such as Minimum Quantity Lubricant (MQL) or dry machining which is more eco-friendly. Use of synthetic and vegetable oil-based esters are mostly used. The first type of sustainable vegetable oil base metal fluids used are based oils like triglycerides, but for these base oils, a proper additive is also required. These base oils are biodegradable and can degrade more easily in soil. Data reports indicated that bio-based fluids performed better than mineral-based oils in terms of better chip breaking, higher durability and lower wear and lower cutting forces. Due to the combination of biodegradability, renewability and excellent lubrication performance they are said to be potential environment-friendly lubricants. These green fluids also do not have any harmful chemicals that complicate the disposal procedure and thereby reducing the disposal cost., Conclusion:, Sustainable production is the most important aspect to be considered by all production engineers, not because it is a fad but a necessity as an obligation to the world we live in. Product Life cycle assessment has become a tool of choice being used to establish the environmental impact of the products that we produce. The three major principles to be considered are reducing the resource utilisation in the process, use environment-friendly materials, reduce all forms of waste and reuse and recycle as much material as possible to realise the goal of the self-recovery capability of the earth.</td>\n",
