A Culture Ride Through Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai,From Buddhist shrines to spicy Lanna food--Thailand's cultural nerve centres Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai have it all.,"Leaning out from a bridge leading into Wat Rong Khun, I squint at a stucco moat of outstretched hands and grisly skeletons. Two massive horns arch over the walkway, while a few steps ahead, giant statues of Death and Rahu guard the entrance, like burly bouncers poised to restrict my entry into heaven. “The bridge of rebirth,” I overhear a foreign couple talking. A swampland of desire—enslaved arms—lie in wait blocking a mortal’s road to nirvana. This was rebirth as an infernal spectre, not Elton John’s PG-13 “Circle of Life.”"
Splendour at Sea in Koh Samui,Simple pleasures of island life mingle with refined indulgence at Belmond Napasai's villa property. ,"After a tiring snorkelling session in the clear waters of Koh Phangan, instructors Captain Pumpui and Captain Poo are shepherding me and five others on a private speedboat to nearby Bottle Beach for a picnic lunch of sandwiches, macarons and fruit juices. I am about 10-12 kilometres from Belmond Napasai’s lush tropical resort in Koh Samui, my home for the last day-and-a-half, and the sun is blindingly bright overhead. This is ideal snorkelling weather; we have had a field day gasping at eels and corals underwater. But the heat has stymied chatter on our boat."
"In Thailand, Nostalgia on Wheels","Riding across Thailand's idyllic villages, Belmond's Eastern & Oriental Express recalls a bygone era of stylish train travel. ","As soon as a long, gleaming dark green train carriage, emblazoned with ‘Eastern & Oriental Express’ in engraved gold lettering slides into Hua Hin station, I feel a tinge of self-consciousness. Neither I nor my co-passengers from India are dressed for something this imperial. For the last hour, we have been milling about Hua Hin, Thailand’s oldest railway station—a quirky but fading royal artefact—in our baggy tees, jeans and dusty shoes, lugging backpacks and satchels. Once I hop aboard the train though, the air is less intimidating. While this is a majestic luxury locomotive boasting every accoutrement of refined sophistication, I see open, friendly faces in casual wear and summer hats."
A City’s State of Mind,"To get under the skin of a great metropolis, unravel the multitude of messy stories it holds within.","The world’s greatest cities are brutal, unsentimental places, precisely the reason why so many of us fall so irrevocably under their spell. In its worst hour, this bond can curdle into bitter complaints of unrequited affection and everyday torment. “The subway doesn’t work, trash is overflowing and it’s too crowded; this is over.” Let me assure you that right now someone somewhere is uttering these words about your dream metropolis, New York, Rome, Rio De Janeiro. Like an unrepentant cad, the city laughs in their face, “Go on… live without me.” Wresting long-term connections comes with the occasional pang of nostalgic regret. Those who can’t escape their love of cities are destined to keep replaying that first flush of romance, that moment when a city went from a destination to home."
The Great Outdoors May Not Be Great for Long,Shouldn't it matter to travellers that the clock is ticking on all the bounty of nature that we have taken for granted?,"Part of the allure of a remote place is that the closer we get to it, the more we risk everything that made it precious. For years, Mount Everest inspired a sense of forbidden majesty, which was surmounted only by a few courageous adventurers. It helped that they were entertaining and we were content to immerse ourselves in the stories they wove from these monumental expeditions."
Searching For Our Pop Culture Gods,Pop culture idols and their stories have the power to shape our earliest definition of places and what we come to expect of them.,"In this modern agnostic world, pop culture is the closest thing we have to a shared religion. Matinee idols, artists and rock stars are our gods and goddesses, feeding us an endless supply of enchanting lore and myths. For this movement to thrive though, it needs fans; followers who have gone beyond aloof observation. Pop culture requires that fans click below to subscribe, not let it just play in the background."
A Bombay Classic That Endures,"Born of the city's streets, the vada pav is proof that time-tested favourites rarely lose their appeal.","New and exciting has always received top billing in food—the latest fad, the newest restaurant, the trendiest neighbourhood, the healthiest diet. Often, these developments are accompanied by breathless pundit-like pronouncements: "
Redefining #Goals,"In the age of instant hype, once-in-a-lifetime journeys are lost in the maze of travel bucket lists.","Once-in-a-lifetime is an overused expression in travel. Like everything else, the phrase has succumbed to a culture of instant hype. When every mountain hike, underwater dive or local meal is described with the glowing praise that should be meant for only the rarest of occurrences, it is difficult to tell a wonderful experience from a bucket list one. A bucket list just doesn’t translate with the same impact it was originally intended for."
Why Our Forests Need Watching,"In order to see animals in the wild, where we are often unwelcome guests, we need to respect the demands of their existence.","J R.R. Tolkien was right to portray the Ents, hulking pieces of tall barks with sad eyes and mossy facial hair who guarded forests, as perhaps the most stoic figures in his "
A Soulmate for Summer,"The season never demands loyalty to a single destination but for many travellers, it signals a return to their favourite annual refuge.","Every summer, the pastoral call of their motherland, Kerala, beckoned my parents. Their children would plead that they change direction at least for one year but these entreaties were dismissed as flakiness. Summer months were set in stone. And contrary to the breezy, game-for-anything attitude that the sun induced in many folks, for my mother and father, it was a season for constancy."
How Deep Is Your Travel Love?,Passion for travel doesn't ring true until it has sustained itself over the long-term and in the face of many rivals or distractions.,"If there is a phrase I would prefer to retire from online bios, personal or professional, it is, “I love travel.” Or some approximation of that sentiment. To clarify, I am not against travellers or those who proudly flaunt their passion for travel. On the contrary, editing a travel magazine has now made me oddly protective of travellers and their ilk. My submission is that “love to travel,” suggested so casually, just doesn’t feel adequate to the depth of emotion it sparks in true devotees."
Travel Inspiration for 2019 : A Book on Nietzsche and Hiking,A philosophy professor's retracing of the German thinker's journeys will reaffirm anyone's passion for wanderlust.,One of the finer books I read this year was John Kaag’s 
What Dreams May Come,"We are in the golden age of accessible travel. But even today, there is a place for luxury that is the stuff of fantasies.","Our year-end edition toasts ultra-indulgence while travelling, featuring itineraries that many will know to be out of their financial reach. In producing these narratives, I was struck by a contrast."
Free on the Outside,A sense of elsewhere and that feeling of dislocation—why the imagery of the great outdoors has endured.,"The great outdoors, around which our November edition pivots, is a deceptive catch-all, as such phrases tend to be. In day-to-day conversations, anything from after-school camping trips to sailing in the waters of Papua New Guinea risks being lumped in the same breath. But whoever put their mind to the term was no doubt thinking of great with a capital G. They were dreaming of outdoors that offer as much dislocation as possible. Where snow peaks rise out of clouds and canyons plunge the recesses of the earth."
In the Mood for Winter,"Stark, freezing and quiet, the season's intense, ethereal beauty carries hidden depths.","Summer is a charming flirt. Easy-going and casual. Summer doesn’t huff and puff to win our affections. It has us at “Hello.” Winter broods like the tortured protagonist of big fat Russian novel. It is daunting and dramatic, burning with a slow intensity."
"Slow Days, Fast Company",The difference between a road trip and any other kind of travel is the same as a trailer and an entire film.,"In the mid-2000s, I had the first of my several brushes with unemployment. This was no well-considered sabbatical. Instead it was a surprise shove that came out of nowhere. Losing a job is crushing but even more so if you are the only one. In the company of a few colleagues though, your shoulders droop less and the gloom takes on a lightheaded spin. You cloak despair in disdain, adopting a “What, me worry?” face. And then, you blot the world, and travel."
Train to Nowhere,Travelling in India comes with a bit of pow-wow and no place prepares you for that more than Bombay.,"I like a bit of pow-wow in any place. Let me rephrase before you think I am eternally hankering for a fight. What I mean is I would choose crooked streets over straight highways, sweaty mayhem over pristine elegance. This is why no matter where I go in this world, coming home to India, and especially Bombay, is never dull. I blame growing up in the city for my pugilistic predilections. One of the many descriptors that Mark Twain used in relation to Bombay was “pow-wow.” The place seemed to confound him: “Bewitching”, “Bewildering”, “Enchanting”, “Arabian Nights come again?”—the man was repulsed and riveted at the same time. It was a place befitting the number of exclamations he used."
Six Years And Counting…,Grappling with an eternal conundrum about travel.,"Anniversary editions have the feel of a graduation: a year of studious slogging (of which, truth be told, my team and I do very little) and madcap fun (which we only wish we could indulge in more) rounded off with a sense of achievement and lingering anxiety. There’s pride that "
Getting Saucy About Food,Scoring cultural brownie points over food is the next best thing to eating it.,"For my money, memorable disagreements often centre on food. A friend who was about to settle abroad was feeling particularly wistful about a storied south Bombay restaurant, the kind of eatery that locals like to call “overrated” and guidebook-toting tourists faithfully make a beeline for. His favourite on the menu? The baklava—a dry fruit-laden traditional sweet that smacked of decadence in every bite."
There is More to France Than Paris,Four cities in Northern France showcase decadent antiquity and a way of life that is charmingly laid-back.,"In 2008, the comedy "
Eye on the Tiger in Madhya Pradesh,The Kanha Earth Lodge and Pench Tree Lodge offer two wildly different jungle experiences.,"It had been a dismal evening for Harpreet “Happy” Dhillon. He veered his open-air green Gypsy to a halt outside a crowded ticketing window in Kanha National Park. Lanky, bearded and soft-spoken, he was a naturalist from the Kanha Earth Lodge, my home in Madhya Pradesh for three days. Happy had driven me and my companion—photographer Riddhi Parekh, on her maiden wildlife assignment—all across the park in search of a memorable tiger sighting."
Champagne: France’s Bottom’s Up Approach,"Inside the atmospheric medieval cellars of Pannier House, an elite champagne maker in northern France.","I check my smartphone for the time—11.40 a.m.—before my attention wheels back to the pressing matter at hand: drinking champagne. Six flutes of the finest white wine from Champagne Pannier, a prestigious house in the scenic Marne Valley of France, have been placed in a shapely cluster on a white tabletop. Standing on one side of that table, in an understated white-walled tasting corner in Pannier’s head office in Chateau-Thierry, Eve Masselaert, the brand’s guest relation manager, is setting the stage for the bubbly."
Life in a Paris Metro,Commuting on the French capital’s busy train lines can be an experience that feels humbling and also universal.,"A few days before my brief stay in Paris this September, I was lurking online amongst the good people of the internet, as you do anytime you want your productivity to hit sub-zero levels, when I chanced upon a reddit communiqué. It was an extended rant, which the internet claims proficiency in. “So you’re going to take the metro in Paris this summer,” said the author before launching into a list of around 20 dos and don’ts for the inexperienced visitor."
"Mountain Getaway | Setting up a Hammock in the Himalayas at Shey Bhumi, Leh","A peaceful retreat with Ladakhi charms, Shey Bhumi even makes good of bad weather.","Shey Bhumi is the kind of place that sends the “panorama” feature on smartphones into overdrive. To be fair, that could also double as an accurate general assessment of Ladakh’s beaten-down and barren magnificence, which seems to evoke inexhaustible astonishment from any vantage point. Shey, in particular though, is unlike many of the other stay options available in Leh, Ladakh’s focal city nestled in the Himalayas. Most hotels or guest houses here are located in and around the central shopping square, and as is wont in so many hinterland towns of India, they strive for urbanity. I, however, was headed to an escape removed from all the hubbub."
Kalki Koechlin’s Art of Travel: Go with the Flow,"Outdoorsy and bohemian, the Margarita with a Straw actress reveals that her favourite trips are always impromptu adventures.","There are moments when the therapeutic benefits of travel can hit home harder than any of the dispassionate advice received on a shrink’s couch. Displacement, in a strictly physical sense, clarifies both mind and body. For Kalki Koechlin, that breakthrough came during a trip to Karuna Farm, a nature retreat near Kodaikanal."
Airbnb India’s Country Manager Amanpreet Bajaj on Making the World Home,"Before it became his occupation, travel was a recurring theme in Bajaj's life.","Amanpreet Bajaj is by all accounts a busy man, whose job entails taking a flight out to somewhere in this world at least once a month, but he is loath to consider himself a typical business traveller. Instead the India country manager of Airbnb, the online rental platform that has reinvented how people travel since 2008, prefers the new-age concept of “bleisure”. The explanation is self-evident: business trips that also afford some of the joys of unencumbered travel."
Taste Trumps Travel…,…Or does it? Taking stock of whether bad food can dissuade true-blue wanderers.,"All of us take cues from our families on how to be or, in many instances, how not to be. When it came to food, I took from mine an open-minded appetite since much of "
